web application
<p>
Movies tracker webb app, something like a watchlist with all the movies that you already seen (e.g. seenthat.com)
Functionality:
<br>-register</br>
<br>-a user can add a movie that he already watched (this will form his own list with all the movies he already watched)</br>
<br>-a user can rate a movie</br>
<br>-a user can add a review to a movie</br>
</p>
I will use MySQL as db, PHP for backend, HTML&CSS for frontend
