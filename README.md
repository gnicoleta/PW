web application

Movies tracker webb app, something like a watchlist with all the movies that you already seen (e.g. seenthat.com)
Functionality:
-register
-a user can add a movie that he already watched (this will form his own list with all the movies he already watched)
-a user can rate a movie
-a user can add a review to a movie

I will use MySQL as db, PHP for backend, HTML&CSS for frontend
